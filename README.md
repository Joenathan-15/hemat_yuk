# What is Hemat Yuk ?

## Dev Note
This project is a rewrite of the <a href="https://github.com/Joenathan-15/hemat-yuk">Hemat Yuk</a> app, which I originally developed in React Native. I rewrote it as a Flutter application to test my Flutter knowledge.

If you want to customize this Application, feel free to fork the repository.
